            <h4>[Verse 1]</h4>
            <p>
                Caught between the shame and the shelter
                Tired and beat up, lost in my mind
                If I could be the man that I wanna be
                I would be someone who can't be denied
            </p>

            <p>
                No, I don't wanna hear it
                I don't wanna slow down
                Caught up in a landslide
                Buried by my damn pride

                No, I don't wanna hear it
                I'm just gonna push it down
                Maybe you won't miss me if I'm not around
                (If I'm not around, if I'm not around)
                Maybe you won't miss me if I'm not around

            <p>
                Conversations rot into nothing
                Stoney silence colder than ice
                Too much time wasted building my walls up
                Unproductive, self-destructive, hangin' upside down
            </p>
